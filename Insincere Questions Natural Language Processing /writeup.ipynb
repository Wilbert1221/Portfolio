    "\n",
    "* According to the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification) prompt for the insincere question is one that \"founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement\" rather than inquire. People use tone and context and intonation and many nonverbal queues to gauge whether or not a question is insincere. Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows computers to make sense of text data and make data driven assumptions. In this case, we are performing binary classification on whether questions are insincere or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* For our project, we are experimenting with the range of techniques available for Natural Language Processing from building and training an LSTM recurrent neural network from scratch to using transfer learning models specifically transformer models like BERT in order to perform binary classification on the dataset. The goal is to train a deep neural network that classifies text questions into categories of sincere or insincere. "

We remove raw components of the text data that are not relevant and useful and make the process of training a model more difficult and confusing. We make all the words lowercase because this makes the data more uniform as we do not have separate words because of capitalization. We remove stopwords because they are the most common words in the language and they do not carry meaning essential to the classification of questions as sincere or insincere. Words that are less than two characters in length are similar to stopwords in that they are commonly conjunctions or prepositions which do not carry significant meaning in determining whether questions are insincere or not.\n",

    "* We have two models that we are comparing. We have an LSTM model and are also implementing a transformer model in order to compare the two. This section provides an overview of the models we created and the rationale behind choosing said models.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * `keras_model`: * We trained a LSTM recurrent neural network from scratch. We were inspired by the simple example that [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn) provides of a Recurrent Neural Network using an LSTM layer through keras. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * `DistilBERT`: DistilBERT is a language represenation model. [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) is described as a \"smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter\" version of BERT. [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) is a language representation model where BERT is an acronym for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT is effective and innovative as it can performs bidirectional training on a Transformer. BERT is an attractive model because of its performance. It has shown impressive results in Natural Language Processing tasks such as \"pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement)\"[4]. But, the BERT model is large and requires alot of time and memory that are outside the capacity of the tools that we have at our disposal. Because of this, we have chosen a variation of the BERT model that is more suited for our capibilities and just as impressive as the BERT model. The DistilBERT model uses knowledge distillation during pretraining and is able to \"reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster\" [3]. We chose the Distilbert model because it is able to perform similarly to the BERT model while being faster and more cost effecient."

    "* Based on our experiments, the best model for classifying insincere questions is the LSTM Recurrent Neural Network keras_model_1 with __ LSTM layer nodes, a learning rate of __ , input length of and including embeddings initializer in the embedding layer of the model. In training and testing this model several times with these settings, we always had a test binary accuracy ranging from .94 to .96 and F1 score ranging from .59 to .625. This model had the highest average F1 score among different hyperparameter configurations for the keras_model. We thought that it was interesting that some models had a higher average recall with a max of 0.72 than the keras_model_1 that had a max of 0.64. F1 score is an average of both precision and recall meaning that it serves as a better metric than precision or recall individually in determining the effectiveness of the model.   \n",

    "* We note that there were significant limitations when gathering experimental results. OOM errors made data collection the most difficult part of this research process. That being said, we acknowledge that there are likely other hyperparameter settings for the keras_model that could have further optimized the model. We also note that regardless of hyperparameter settings our results for DistilBERT are inconclusive. The binary accuracy ranges from .92 to .94. This is likely due to the imbalance of classes in the dataset for both the LSTM and keras_model. For the DistilBERT model, the precision, recall and F1 score are 0 leading to unclear results in terms of how to vary hyperparameters to optimize the DistilBERT model. The DistilBERT model offers an effectively rigorous and more efficient alternative to the BERT model but we were still unable to make any conclusions given the results of our experiment. \n",

    "* Overall, we believe that our keras_model is not very effective in classifying questions as sincere or insincere. Our average F1 score on our most successful model would not place us in the top 1000 submissions for the Kaggle's Insincere Question competition. Most models had accuracy over 90 percent but this was not indicative due to the imbalance of classes. Many of our models had precision, recall and F1 scores averaging over .5 for each. Our best models seemed to represent the F1 scores, precision and recall range of our peers. \n",

    "* If we had had more time and had not had OOM errors at various points, we would have liked to run a more comprehensive set of experiments  more drastically varying the hyperparameters tested and further testing the effect of batch size and steps per epoch. We believe this might result in a much better model overall. We also were curious to possibly implement the winning submission for the competition. That being said, we put a lot of time into this project and think that given the time and memory constraints, we did the best we could."
