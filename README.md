### **A* Star Search and Heurisitc Functions**

* An implementation of the A star search algorithm along with three different heuristic functions in order to investigate the impact of the heuristic functions on search performance. The folder also contains the accompanying paper describing the results of the research.

### **American Sign Language Image Classification**

Experimented with several deep learning transfer learning models available for image classification in order to perform multi-class classification on the dataset. The goal is to train a deep neural network that classifies the dataset and provides a model that accurately predicts the different letters of the sign language alphabet. The blog_post.ipynb file contains a detailed account of the experimental process and a clear overview of the coding done.

### **Genetic Programming and Symbolic Regression**

* Genetic Programming is used to implement Symbolic Regression. An Elitist method is used for parent selection. The folder also contains the accompanying paper describing the results of the research.

### **Natural Language Processing: Insincere Questions Quora**

* Trained an LSTM model with F1 scores above .65 and attempted to train a DistilBERT transformer model which resulted in unclear results. The writeup.ipynb file contains a detailed account of the experimental process and a clear overview of the coding done.

### **MNIST Digit Image Classification**

* Implementation of densely-connected neural networks in order to solve classifying handwritten digits from MNIST dataset and also classifying a Kuzushiji dataset. with at least 95% accuracy.

### **Pneumonia Chest X-Ray Image Classification**

* Experimented with different techniques available for Deep Learning image classification from building convolutional neural networks from scratch to using transfer learning models in order to perform binary classification on image dataset. The writeup.ipynb file contains a detailed account of the experimental process and a clear overview of the coding done.
